   /* Bottom-up construction of out-of-core octree in postorder traversal.
    * The octree oct is assumed to be initialised with its origin (oct ->
    * org), size (oct -> size), key callback (oct -> key), and its
    * associated leaf file (oct -> leafFile).  
    
    * Records are read from the leafFile and assumed to be sorted in
    * Z-order, which defines an octree leaf ordering.  Leaves (terminal
    * nodes) are constructed such that they contain <= leafMax records and
    * have a maximum depth of maxDepth.
    
    * Note that the following limits apply:
    *    leafMax  <= OOC_OCTCNT_MAX     (see oococt.h)
    *    maxDepth <= OOC_MORTON_BITS    (see oocsort.h)
    
    * The maxDepth limit arises from the fact that the Z-ordering has a
    * limited resolution and will map node coordinates beyond a depth of
    * OOC_MORTON_BITS to the same Z-index, causing nodes to be potentially
    * read out of sequence and winding up in the wrong octree nodes.
     
    * On success, the octree pointer oct is returned, with the constructed
    * nodes in oct -> nodes, and the node count in oct -> numNodes.  On
    * failure, NULL is returned.  */
