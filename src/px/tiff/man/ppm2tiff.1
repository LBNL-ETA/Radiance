.TH PPM2TIFF 1 "October 15, 1995"
.SH NAME
ppm2tiff \- create a
.SM TIFF
file from a 
.SM PPM
image file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ppm2tiff
[
.I options
] [
.I input.ppm
]
.I output.tif
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ppm2tiff
converts a file in the 
.SM PPM
image format to
.SM TIFF.
By default, the
.SM TIFF
image is created with data samples packed (\c
.IR PlanarConfiguration =1),
compressed with the Lempel-Ziv & Welch algorithm (\c
.IR Compression =5),
and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.
These characteristics can be overriden, or explicitly specified
with the options described below
.PP
If the
.SM PPM
file contains greyscale data, then the
.I PhotometricInterpretation
tag is set to 1 (min-is-black),
otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB).
.PP
If no
.SM PPM
file is specified on the command line,
.I ppm2tiff
will read from the standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Specify a compression scheme to use when writing image data:
.B "\-c none"
for no compression,
.B "-c packbits"
for the PackBits compression algorithm (the default),
.B "-c jpeg"
for the baseline JPEG compression algorithm,
.B "-c zip
for the Deflate compression algorithm,
and
.B "\-c lzw"
for Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression.
.TP
.B \-r
Write data with a specified number of rows per strip;
by default the number of rows/strip is selected so that each strip
is approximately 8 kilobytes.
.TP
.B \-R
Mark the resultant image to have the specified
X and Y resolution (in dots/inch).
