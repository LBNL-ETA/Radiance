			SETTING RENDERING OPTIONS

The table below gives some useful ranges for some Radiance 2.4 parameters.
The "min" value gives the fastest, crudest rendering.  It is not
necessarily the smallest value numerically.  The "fast" value gives
a reasonably fast rendering.  The "accur" value gives a reasonably
accurate rendering.  The "max" value gives the ultimate in accuracy.

NOTES:
        A) This option does not affect the rendering time
        B) This option adversely affects image sampling (ie. use -ps 1)
	C) Maximum value disables optimization and can be very expensive

		TIMINGS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS

Param   Effect on Execution Time
=====   ==================================================================
-ps     inverse, halving value increases rendering time up to four times
-pt     minor, decreasing value causes modest increase in rendering time
-pj     no effect
-pm	no effect
-pd	no effect
-dj     indirect, increasing value requires -ps parameter to be reduced
-ds     inverse, halving value causes rendering time to approximately double
-dt     inverse, halving value causes rendering time to increase about 50%
-dc     direct, affects rendering time up to 50% over its 0 to 1 range
-dr	direct, depending on the scene each new reflection can double time
-dp	minor, affects start-up time only, higher values take longer
-ss	no effect until > 1, then linear increase for specular surfaces
-st	minor, a value of zero may increase rendering by 50% over maximum of 1
-ab	direct, doubling this value can double rendering time
-aa	direct, halving this value approximately quadruples rendering time
-ar	direct, effect depends on scene, can quadruple time for double value
-ad	direct, doubling value may double rendering time
-as	direct, effectively adds to -ad parameter and its cost
-ms	direct, halving value increases time by a factor of two in mist regions
-lr	minor, increase causes very slightly longer rendering time
-lw	minor, decrease causes very slightly longer rendering time
