# RCSid "$Id$"

Hyperspectral rendering was introduced to Radiance in version 6.0,
released in the second half of 2025.

Not all Radiance commands fully support hyperspectral data where they
should.  This note tracks which programs and tools fully support
hyperspectral, which tools partially support it, and which do not.
Partial support typically means a tool reads hyperspectral data but
does not write it, and colors may be very approximate.
Tools that could support hyperspectral data but do not may fail
if fed such data.  Utilities that have no potential for interaction 
with hyperspectral data are left off these lists for brevity.

Lists are sorted alphabetically rather than by application areas.
