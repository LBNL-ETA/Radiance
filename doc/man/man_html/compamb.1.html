compamb - compute good ambient value for a rad input file

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

<b>compamb</b> 
[

</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

<i>Compamb</i> 
computes a good ambient value for the specified
<i>rad(1)</i> 
variable file and appends it to the file as a "render= -av" option.
If the
<i>-c</i> 
option is specified, then
<i>compamb</i> 
includes color information in the computed ambient value, rather than
estimating a grey value to avoid rendering color shifts.
If the
<i>-e</i> 
option is specified, then
<i>compamb</i> 
also computes a good exposure value for this scene, and appends it to
the
<i>rad</i> 
file as well.

<p>
<i>Compamb</i> 
is a shell script that makes calls to other RADIANCE programs and utilities
to do the actual work.
A substantial amount of time may be required to complete this script, since
<i>compamb</i> 
calls
<i>rpict(1)</i> 
to render low resolution frames for each view in the
<i>rad</i> 
file, setting "QUALITY=High" to compute interreflections.
The resulting ambient file is thrown away, since it would disagree
with the new -av setting used for the final renderings.
This method is preferable to setting the
<i>-aw</i> 
option of
<i>rpict,</i> 
which frequently results in splotchy artifacts.
