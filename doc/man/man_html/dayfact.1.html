dayfact - compute illuminance and daylight factor on workplane

</ul><H2>SYNOPSIS </H2><ul>

<b>dayfact</b> 
[
falsecolor options

</ul><H2>DESCRIPTION </H2><ul>

<i>Dayfact</i> 
is an interactive script for computing workplane illuminance,
and daylight factors and potential daylight savings using
<i>rtrace(1).</i> 
The script
<i>falsecolor(1)</i> 
is then used to draw contour lines on the resulting Radiance
picture.
