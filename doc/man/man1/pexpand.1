.SH NAME
pexpand - expand requested commands in metafile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pexpand
[
.B +/\-EPDOCSURIlrtmvsp
]
file ..
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pexpand
reads each metafile
.I file
in sequence and expands any commands specified in a '+' option,
and deletes any commands specified in a '-' option.
This is necessary because most drivers will not support many
metafile commands such as 'v' (vector string) and 'O', 'C', and 's'
(segments).
.I Pexpand
will expand '+' instances into the corresponding primitives which
are supported, and delete all '-' instances.
.PP
Certain commands are currently considered basic, and must be supported
by all drivers.
The commands 'D', 'E', 'S', 'U', 'R', 'l', 'r', and 't' are
basic (see metafile(5)).
.PP
If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.
.TP 10n
.BR +EPDOCSURIlrtmvsp
