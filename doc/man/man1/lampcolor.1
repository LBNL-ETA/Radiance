.TH LAMPCOLOR 1 11/15/93 RADIANCE
.SH NAME
lampcolor - compute spectral radiance for diffuse emitter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lampcolor
[
lamptable
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lampcolor
is an interactive program for computing the appropriate color
for a diffuse emitter.
From the total lumen output and a simple description of the fixture
geometry, the radiance for a diffuse fixture is calculated.
Since most light fixtures are not really diffuse, the preferred
method is to use luminaire distribution data (see
.I ies2rad(1)).
.PP
A table of lamp colors and depreciation factors is used to get
the color for a specific lamp type.
If "white" is specified, the lamp will be uncolored.
This is probably preferable for scenes with only a single variety
of lamp in order to produce color-balanced images.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
