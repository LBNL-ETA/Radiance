.SH NAME
lookamb - examine ambient file values
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lookamb
[
.B \-d
][
.B \-r
][
.B \-h
]
[
.B ambfile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lookamb
examines an ambient file produced by
.I rpict(1),
.I rtrace(1),
or
.I rvu(1).
The default mode prints the position, direction, level, weight,
radius, value, position gradient and direction gradient
for each stored ambient value preceded by a
label appropriate for human interpretation.
The 
.I \-d
option prints the same quantities in 18 columns without any expanatory
text, and is more appropriate as input to another program.
.PP
The
.I \-r
option performs the reverse conversion, taking the output of lookamb
and reproducing the original ambient file on the standard output.
.PP
The
.I \-h
option causes lookamb not to print out the header information on the
output, or not to expect it on the input with the
.I \-r
option.
.PP
If no file is given,
.I lookamb
reads from the standard input.
.SH NOTES
Before release 2.2 of Radiance, ambient files were in a
machine-dependent format.
Since that is no longer the case, ambient files can now be moved
freely between machines without any conversions.
Thus, the only reason to use
.I lookamb
now is to examine the contents of an ambient file.
