.SH NAME
xglaresrc - dislpay glare sources under X11
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xglaresrc
[
.B "\-n windowname"
][
.B "\-c r g b"
]
.B pictfile
[
.B glarefile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xglaresrc
displays the sources located by
.I findglare(1)
in the picture
.I pictfile
by displaying their average luminance and
drawing circles around them in the image.
If
.I pictfile
is already being displayed by
.I ximage(1),
.I xglaresrc
will raise (or deiconify) this window.
If
.I pictfile
is not being displayed,
.I xglaresrc
will start
.I ximage(1)
in the background automatically.
(To quit from
.I ximage(1),
you can type 'q' in its display window.)
Usually,
.I pictfile
will be the image that was used by
.I findglare(1)
to locate glare sources.
.PP
If the desired image is being displayed under a different
name, perhaps even by a different display program than
.I ximage(1),
the
.I \-n
option can be used to give an alternative 
.I windowname
for locating the correct display window, and the
.I \-c
option can be used to specify a different line and text color
(default 1 0 0).
If the inpute
.I glarefile
is not given,
.I xglaresrc
reads from its standard input.
