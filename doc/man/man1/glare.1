.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Glare
is an interactive script for executing programs used to locate
glare sources and compute glare indices and visual comfort probability.
If no
.I glarefile
is given, the program prompts the user for a one.
If the file does not exist,
.I glare
asks the user some questions about the scene in question then runs
.I findglare(1)
to compute values to store in the file.
.I Glare
then presents the user a menu of available glare index calculations.
After choosing a calculation,
.I glare
offers to store the result (usually not useful) or plot the information
(but only for multiple glare angles).
.PP
If you are creating a new
.I glarefile,
it usually works best to start with a displayed image for reference
during the interrogation.
