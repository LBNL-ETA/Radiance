.TH XSHOWTRACE 1 11/15/93 RADIANCE
.SH NAME
xshowtrace - interactively show rays traced on RADIANCE image under X11
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xshowtrace
[
.B \-s
][
.B \-T
][
.B "rtrace options"
]
.B octree
.B picture
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xshowtrace
takes a RADIANCE octree and a picture file
and displays it on an X11 window server using
.I ximage(1).
The picture should have been created from a previous
.I rpict(1)
or
.I rvu(1)
calculation using the given octree.
Once the image is displayed, the user can use the 't' command of
.I ximage
to select points on the image to display the ray tree.
.I Rtrace
then produces a ray tree, which
.I xshowtrace
will display (in red on a color screen).
The
.I \-s
option slows the display of each ray traced to make it easier to
follow the process.
The
.I \-T
option traces rays to light sources, which are normally hidden.

.SH BUGS
If the pointer is moved between the time 't' is pressed and
.I xshowtrace
starts drawing rays, the rays will be displaced.
