.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Psort
reads each metafile
.I file
in sequence and sorts primitives between globals according to
the option specification.
Lower case options mean the corresponding minimum, upper case
indicates the maximum value.
A '+' before the option means sort in order of increasing
values, '-' means decreasing.
The order the options appear on the command line is the order
in which the extrema are examined.
For example, the options
.I \-Y +x
would mean "sort on decreasing ymax, then increasing xmin values".
.PP
If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.
.SH EXAMPLE
To sort the file "meta" in order of increasing xmax, then
decreasing ymin:
.IP "" .2i
psort +X \-y meta
.SH FILES
/tmp/psXXXXa /tmp/psXXXXb
.SH BUGS
