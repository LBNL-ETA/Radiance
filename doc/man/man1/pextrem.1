.TH PEXTREM 1 11/15/93 RADIANCE
.SH NAME
pextrem - find minimum and maximum values in RADIANCE picture
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pextrem
[
.B "-o | -O"
]
[
picture
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pextrem
locates the minimum and maximum values for the input
.I picture,
and prints their pixel locations and color values.
The first line printed contains the x and y pixel location
(x measured from the left margin, y measured from the bottom),
followed by the red, green and blue values.
The second line printed contains the same information for the
maximum value.
.PP
The
.I \-o
option prints the original (radiance) values, undoing any exposure
or color correction done on the picture.
If the input is XYZE, then the second channel is in candelas/meter^2,
unless
.I \-O
is specified, when watts/sr/meter^2 are always reported.
.PP
If no input 
.I picture
is given, the standard input is read.

.SH BUGS
The luminance value is used for comparison of pixels, although in
certain anomolous cases (ie. highly saturated colors) it is possible that
.I pextrem
will not pick the absolute minimum or maximum luminance value.
This is because a fast integer-space comparison is used.
A more reliable floating-point comparison would be slower by
an order of magnitude.
