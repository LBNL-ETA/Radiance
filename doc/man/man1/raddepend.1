.SH NAME
raddepend - find RADIANCE scene dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B raddepend
file ..
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Raddepend
uses
.I getbbox(1)
to expand scene file arguments and find file dependencies for
.I make(1)
or
.I rad(1).
.I Raddepend
looks only in the current directory,
so dependencies hidden elsewhere in the filesystem will not be found
or named.
.PP
The output is the name of files, one per line, that were accessed
during the expansion of the input file arguments.
The file arguments are excluded from the list.
If no input files are given, the standard input is read.

.SH BUGS
On some older NFS systems, the file access dates are not updated
promptly.
As a result,
.I raddepend
may not be 100% reliable on these systems.
If the output seems to be missing essential files, this is
no doubt why.
The only fix is to put in a longer sleep time between the
.I getbbox
call and the final
.I ls(1).
