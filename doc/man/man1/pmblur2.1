.SH NAME
pmblur2 - apply motion blur to a frame from an animation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmblur2
.B f0,f1/n
.B HDRspec
.B ZBFspec
.B MVOspec
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pmblur2
Computes a square-shutter blur from frame position
.I f0
to frame position
.I f1
using the given picture, depth buffer, and motion vector offset files
produced by
.I ranimove(1).
These arguments should be set similarly to the
.I BASENAME,
.I ZNAME,
and
.I MNAME
variables in the
.I ranimove
input file, but should include the suffixes as well.
.PP
The starting and ending frame number are usually given as floating-point
values.
For example, the range "10.75,11.25" would simulate a 180-degree shutter
around frame 11.
An optional time slice count may be given to override the one that is
computed by default.
The range "5,15/30" would blur all the frames from 5 to 15 continuously
using 30 time slices.
The blurred image is always sent to stdout.
.SH EXAMPLES
To blur and downsample frame 95 with a 360-degree shutter:
.IP "" .2i
pmblur2 94.5,95.5 frame%03d.hdr frame%03d.zbf frame%03d.mvo | pfilt -1 -x /2 -y /2 > final95.hdr
