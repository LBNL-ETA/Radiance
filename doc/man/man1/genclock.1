.TH GENCLOCK 1 4/9/97 RADIANCE
.SH NAME
genclock - generate a RADIANCE description of a clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B genclock
[
.B "\-f face_mat"
][
.B "\-c case_mat"
][
.B "\-n name"
]
{
.B HH:MM
|
.B hours
}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Genclock
produces a RADIANCE scene description of an analog clock showing the
given hour.
The hour may either be given as
.I HH:MM
or decimal
.I hours.
.PP
The face of the clock will have a radius of 1.0 units, with the
surrounding case 1.1 (2.2 diameter).
The origin is at the center of the back, and the face looks in the
positive X-direction.
The 12 o'clock direction corresponds to the positive Z-axis.
(The Y-axis direction is 3 o'clock.)\0
The
.I xform(1)
command may be used to resize and relocate the clock as desired.
.PP
Normally,
.I genclock
produces all of the materials necessary for its own description, but
options are provided to specify alternate materials for the face and
case.
The numbers on the face are in dark lettering, so the face material
must be relatively light for them to show up well.
By default, the clock is given the name "clock," but this may be
changed with the
.I \-n
option.
.SH EXAMPLE
To produce a 12 inch diameter clock showing 10:35
and hang it at 60 on a wall facing the Y-direction at Y=10:
.IP "" .2i
genclock 10:35 | xform \-s 6 \-rz 90 \-t 20 10 60
