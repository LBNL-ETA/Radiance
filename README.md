## Source
The source of radiance is located under [**master branch**](https://github.com/MingboPeng/Radiance/tree/master), and you should **NEVER** work on this Radiance master branch directly. Any manual edits on this radiance branch will be overridden and would potentially break the auto-update script.

All files are imported from Radiance CVS via git-cvsimport, and this is a one-way sync. Any updates in this master branch will NOT affect CVS source. 

Unit testing is included in every build and OS system. Please visit https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Radiance/tree/master/test to check all tests. 

## Installer
An installer will be built for Winodws, Mac OSX, and Linux, and released weekly, please visit: https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Radiance/releases to download. Installers are listed under assets of each release.
