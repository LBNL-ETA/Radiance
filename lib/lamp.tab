#
# This is a table of light sources used by ies2rad and pfilt to obtain
# lamp colors and lumen depreciation factors.
#
# It is often best to customize this file for individual applications
# and manufacturers.
#
# The following list of lamp types should be ordered in decreasing
# specificity, since the first match will be the one used.
# Regular expressions can be enclosed by any character except #.
# Upper and lower case is ignored in expressions.
# Aliases should follow their correspondants as closely as
# possible, unless the specification is so short that there might
# be many accidental matches -- such a code should be put near the end.
# Aliases must be enclosed in parenthesis.  A lamp specification
# is three real numbers between 0 and 1:  x y and m, where x and y are
# the CIE chromaticity coordinates and m is the lumen depreciation
# factor (multiplier to get mean lumen output from initial lumens).
